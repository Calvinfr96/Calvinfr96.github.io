    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I have always had a passion for studying math and science, particularly because of the problem solving and
        critical thinking that is required to gain a thorough understanding of these subjects. After studying mechanical
        engineering in college for several years, taking several introductory programming courses along the way, I
        decided that my passion for programming outweighed my passion for engineering. I stopped going to school so I
        could start to further pursue this passion. I started to teach myself Python by taking an introductory course on
        Udemy. I really enjoyed the course and decided that I wanted to pursue Software Development as a career. I am
        now studying Software Development part-time
        at the Flatiron School. </p>
