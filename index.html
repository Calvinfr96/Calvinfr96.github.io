        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have always had a passion for studying math and science, particularly because of the problem solving and
            critical thinking that is required to gain a thorough understanding of these subjects. After studying
            mechanical
            engineering in college for several years, taking several introductory programming courses along the way, I
            decided that my passion for programming outweighed my passion for engineering. I stopped going to school so
            I
            could start to further pursue this passion. I started to teach myself Python by taking an introductory
            course on
            Udemy. I really enjoyed the course and decided that I wanted to pursue Software Development as a career. I
            am
            now studying Software Development part-time
            at the Flatiron School. </p>
