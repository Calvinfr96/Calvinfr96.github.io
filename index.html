            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I have always had a passion for studying math and science, particularly because of the problem solving
                and
                critical thinking that is required to gain a thorough understanding of these subjects. After studying
                mechanical engineering in college for several years, taking several introductory programming courses
                along
                the way, I decided that my passion for programming outweighed my passion for engineering. I stopped
                going to
                school so I could start to further pursue this passion. I started to teach myself Python by taking an
                introductory course on Udemy. I really enjoyed the course and decided that I wanted to pursue Software
                Development as a career. I am now studying Software Development part-time at the Flatiron School. </p>
